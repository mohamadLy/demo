# Toll road 

This is example of toll road that uses video camera to take picture of the passing cars and send it to central system for processing.

The central system checks if the driver is subsciber or not. If he/she is then only save the trip otherwise an invoice is generated and send to mailing system to be mail the driver.


Note: This is a simple demo that demonstrate the usage of kafka, akka, elasticsearch and redis.
